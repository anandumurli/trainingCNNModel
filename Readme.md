## Model Training
This is code is for developing a model that can be used to train a CNN using the FER-13 dataset.
I got my version of the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013/data)

I did not use the complete dataset and wanted to train my CNN on only a few of the facial features instead of all the ones present.

# How to run
These are brief steps to run the file and have it train on the dataset.
1. Download the code and the dataset.
2. Create a virtual environment ```python -m venv .```. - Optional Step
3. Import all the requirements from the requirements.txt file ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.
4. Run the main.py file ```python main.py```.
